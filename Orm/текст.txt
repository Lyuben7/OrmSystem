Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in C# is a technique that converts data between C# objects and relational databases, enabling developers to interact with databases using object-oriented programming rather than writing raw SQL queries.
 This approach maps C# classes to database tables and instances of those classes to rows in the tables, simplifying data persistence and management.

The most widely used ORM for C# and ASP.NET Core is Entity Framework Core (EF Core), which provides a data layer through classes that extend DbContext.
 EF Core is recommended for general use due to its strong support, integration with ASP.NET Core, and ability to handle common CRUD operations efficiently.
 It supports multiple databases and helps prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.

Another popular option is Dapper, a lightweight and high-performance library for data access and ORM that supports .NET Core and C#.
 Dapper is known for its speed and simplicity, making it ideal for scenarios where performance is critical or when developers prefer more direct control over SQL queries.
 It is often used alongside EF Core in a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architecture, where Dapper handles read operations and EF Core manages writes.

Other ORMs include LINQ to SQL, which is free but less commonly used today
 , and alternatives like Linq2Db, NPoco, and LLBLGen Pro, which offer varying levels of performance, flexibility, and advanced features such as support for CTEs and window functions.
 Some developers choose to avoid full ORMs altogether, opting for lightweight solutions like Dapper or even custom data access layers to maintain fine-grained control over database interactions.

In summary, Entity Framework Core is the default choice for most C# projects due to its comprehensive feature set and ecosystem support, while Dapper is favored for performance-critical applications or when developers prefer minimal abstraction over SQL.
